# Contract errors

After Foundation core#711, document lookup answers `InvalidParameterFormat` when `data` is not a JSON object, or when an identifier key is an object, an array, `null`, or a number where text is expected. Several wrong values come back as one `MultipleErrors`. A missing or empty key stays `MissingParameter`. Entry numbers still accept numbers.

Document types that resolve an identifier list these error codes:

- `InvalidParameterFormat` on `data`
- `InvalidParameterFormat` on the identifier key
- one `MultipleErrors` entry

This applies to transfer order, assembly order, undo, and reservation create lookups. Contract tests still have to assert those codes after the Foundation publish.

## Issue status on main 147e8a6

- #39 undo shipment, receipt, and assembly call the standard undo codeunits.
- #40 item application unapply and reapply call `Item Jnl.-Post Line`.
- #30-#33 stay unwired in SourceGuards.yaml until the guards pass and infrastructure review approves them.
